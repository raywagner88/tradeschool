## Overview

**Placeholder Epic - Future Consideration**

## Key Features (Potential)

- SEVIS integration
- I-20 document management
- F-1 visa status tracking
- OPT/CPT application management
- International student reporting
- Visa expiration tracking
- SEVIS compliance

## Status

**Future Consideration - Not Currently Planned**

## Notes

This epic is included as a placeholder for potential future development. Most trade schools do not have significant international student populations, but this feature may be valuable for schools that do serve international students or plan to expand internationally.

If implemented, this epic would require:
- Integration with SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System)
- I-20 document generation and management
- F-1 visa status tracking
- OPT (Optional Practical Training) and CPT (Curricular Practical Training) management
- International student compliance reporting
- Integration with Admissions for international applications
- Integration with Financial Aid for international student aid
